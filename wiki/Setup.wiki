= Introduction =

This is a brief tutorial on how to install gLapse in your GNU/Linux system. I'ts so short because setting gLapse up it's terribly easy, so... Have fun!


= Debian based distributions =

If you have a Debian based distribution it's your lucky day because there's a neat gLapse .deb package waiting for you. Follow the next steps:

  # Download the .deb package from the [http://code.google.com/p/glapse/downloads/list Downloads] section.
  # Install de .deb package double clicking it
  # Run gLapse from the Applications menu or by typing "glapse" in your terminal.


= Other GNU/Linux distributions=

Installing gLapse in a non Debian based distribution only require a couple additional steps, so don't panic.

  # Download the source package from the [http://code.google.com/p/glapse/downloads/list Downloads] section.
  # Decompress it.
  # Install the dependencies (ffmpeg, python, pygtk and scrot) with your distribution's package manager.
  # Access gLapse folder from a terminal.
  # Type {{{sudo make install}}}.
  # Run gLapse from the Applications menu or by typing "glapse" in your terminal.
