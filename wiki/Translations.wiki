gLapse uses gettext as a library to provide its multilanguage feature since it's considered nearly a standard. A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_gettext gettext] translation is made of two files:

  * .po file: plain text file with string pairs (english text and second language text). It's intended for human reading and editing only.
  * .mo file: binary version of a .po file.
