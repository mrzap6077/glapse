## What is gLapse? ##

**gLapse has moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/siondream/glapse)**

gLapse stands for Gnome Time lapse, is a simple GTK tool that allows you to take lots of screenshots at fixed intervals. Then you can glue them together to produce a time lapse video.

It was conceived to be used at Ludum Dare 48h game development competition by Linux people but you can also try it! It doesn't have a huge variety of options but it's pretty easy to use.
